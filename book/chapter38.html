We pull up to Diamond 369, a strip club right outside downtown. "Uh...what are we doing here?" "Just relax. We're meeting a guy here in just a few minutes" Davidson tells me. A black Limo pulls up next to us. “Come on” Davidson motions for me to get out. I see a bigger guy with white hair get out of the Limo. He’s got sunglasses on. He looks deadly serious. The sun is beating down so I assume that’s normal. It’s hot as hell outside today. We head inside. The inside of the club smells like old sweat and bad beer. It makes me wanna vomit. The dancers all seem to be in their early 20s. It’s just a pretty depressing scene all around. I can’t even imagine having to deal with these creepy motherfuckers every day. Yeah, I took a good look around.What the fuck did you expect me to do? Davidson points to an empty booth near the back. The music is so loud it’s hurting my ears. Why the hell is music so loud these days. Back in my day, music was just the right volume and wasn’t so fucking annoying. We sit down in the booth. The seat is sticky as hell. I would expect no less from a joint like this. “Davidson, who is this old motherfucker?” the guy in the glasses asks. “Oh him...he’s going to be the answer to all our problems.” Davidson replies. “You think this guy is going to be able to handle the job? I’ve got guys from Washington calling me repeatedly saying it needs to be done as soon as possible.” The guy in the glasses says as he looks me over. “Look, I don’t know exactly what this is all about. I just wandered into something I know nothing about. Could you just let me go. Believe me. I’m washed up. I’m of no value to you. Please just let me go, and you’ll never hear another goddamned thing from me” “Well, sadly it’s not going to be that simple” Davison says with a smile. What the fuck is he so happy about. Why the fuck are we talking to this dude with the glasses? What the fuck do they want me to do? I look up at the television overhead. I can barely hear the news anchor over the roar of the music. “The small town murder spree that has caught the attention of all of America has a major update today. The murder of Connie Jerret that happened recently has seemingly been solved. The police have released a statement that the prints that were found on the murder weapon, a hatchet,  have led back to a felon by the name of Dexter Bateman. However, due to Bateman being out of the state when the other murders occurred, there seems to be nothing connecting him to the other unsolved homicides. Channel 4 will keep you up to date with all the latest developments.”
