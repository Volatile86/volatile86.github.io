            <p class="text-big">The place was still piled high with as much shit as possible when I arrive. I didn’t expect any less. This place doesn’t get cleaned up often, if ever. After I once again navigate my way to the door, I’m greeted by Sara’s mother on the porch. “Look Lillian, I need to know what’s going on with the boy’s father slash uncle. What’s the deal there?” “Why is it any of your business? I don’t even know your name and you know my entire life story”, she replied. “Well Lillian, seems like you left some stuff out, some possible incestual stuff. Spill the beans. I don’t have all fucking day.” “What can I tell you. I have no idea who the father is, but yes, it could be Robert.” “What kind of person are you that you would conceive a child with your own brother? He is your brother right?” “Yes, he is my brother, and if it happened I don’t remember it. He says it happened, but I was in a bad place around the time I got pregnant. I had been around the block with many guys. I was strung out on pills. I didn’t even know where I was most of the time.”, she said ashamed. “Why didn’t you go get a fucking paternity test to see if he’s the kid’s father?”. “Well, I really don't want to know. I also don’t want Trevor to know that his uncle and his dad are the same person. I don’t know how either of us would deal with it.”, she said while looking down at the ground. “Well, are you sure you even had relations with him? How would you know?”. “He’s the one who told me that we he had sex. I wouldn’t have even believed him, but he told me I had a tattoo in an area that no one who hasn’t seen me naked in the past 10 years would know about.”, she explained. That got me thinking. I don’t like thinking, but I gotta get my ass paid. I was actually able to afford a ham sandwich last night. I was eating like a king now that I had some coin in my pocket, and I don’t want that to end, at least not yet. I gotta make some headway in this case. I bid Lillian a farewell. I faintly hear her ask what my name is before I start my shitheap and drive away.
