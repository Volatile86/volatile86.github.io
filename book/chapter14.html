            <p class="text-big">I wake up with my heart racing. My palms are drenched in sweat. I don't know what the fuck that was or what it means.  Where the hell did Chinatown come from? I haven't even been down there for years. Who was that woman? I'm an old fuck, but I'd still really like to meet her even if she pulls a gun on me. It's only 4 AM. I get up, make some breakfast and just sit there. Stockwell wants some progress soon or he's kicking me to the curb. I look down at my cereal. If I don't find something out soon, I'm gonna be eating mayonnaise sandwiches again. That dream is bothering me. There’s something about it that just seemed so real. I start thinking about the Asian woman again. I’ve seen her somewhere before. It’s strange. It’s like I knew her very intimately in another life, but I don’t know why I feel that way. I doubt it means anything. I figure most of the things that Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud came up with was utter horseshit anyway. Dreams don’t mean anything. They are just random bits of energy firing off when I’m sleeping. I’ve got to stop looking so much into things that have no evidence to back them up. I think about the tattoo that Lillian had said she had. I think about Lillian herself. I’m not sure how a person lives with what she may or may not have done. Unless she has no morals or empathy, it must be tearing her up inside to look at her boy everyday and where he may have come from. I know she had told me that she didn’t want to get a test to see if he was the father, but what’s worse: knowing or not knowing? I finish my cereal and turn on the TV. The top story is about another girl turned inside out and thrown by the interstate. I figure it’s the same guy that’s done all the rest. There are some fucking monsters out there. My daily dose of state propaganda comes on, and I immediately turn the TV off. I don’t need to hear any of that made up shit. I’ve got one day left before Stockwell is going to retire me from my position. My lights are about to be shut off yet again, and I really need a steady stream of income. I could never get that lucky. I close my eyes, and I see a unicorn running through a dense forest. I’ve seen it many times, always when I’m dreaming or when I close my eyes and relax. It’s running from something, or I could be wrong. It could be running towards someone. I open my eyes, throw the cereal bowl in the kitchen sink and exit my humble abode.
