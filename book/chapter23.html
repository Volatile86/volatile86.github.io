            <p class="text-big">I know there was someone in that room. I know it was the same room from my dream. That mystical dream bullshit is starting to not seem so far fetched. Either that or my brain is permanently fried. I hear the smooth roll of the pavement underneath me as my car creeps into oblivion. I turn on the radio. Through the speakers, I hear the same old tired song. It’s a song that has gone through a million speakers. It’s a song that has been tuned out uncountable times. I make my way back to the serpent. The house is about half full. It’s a pretty laid back vibe tonight. I walk up to the bar, and it’s the guy from the first night I came in. “Give me something light. Give me something fucking cheap. I’m broke.” “All right old man, you watch yourself tonight though” he says as he passes over a mug. I drink a little of it. It’s not as bad as I remember, if it is the same beer I had last time. “You know a guy named Don?” “The only Don I know is a friend of mine that works down at Blue Harvest. Why you ask?” he says. “Is he a good tattoo artist? I was thinking about getting some more ink. I just got this one a few days ago.” I show him the triangle I have. “That’s kinda weird man. What would make you want to get something like that?” he asks. “What is so weird about it?” “I don’t know. It just doesn’t seem like something an old person would get. It’s just fucking weird. You’re kind of a nut though aren’t you?” he says. I sit there and think about it for a minute. I can see how someone from the outside might think it’s a little weird. I’m probably losing it a little bit too. My best days are over. This is it. This case or non-case, since I’m not even getting paid anymore, might be my last chance to make a positive mark on the world. “Yeah, it’s weird. I’m losing it. Anyway, before I lose my train of thought. What do you know about Don?” “Is this an interrogation or what, old man? He’s a friend of mine I’ve known forever.” he replies. I just need to come out and ask the question. Fuck it! I’m doing it. “What is going on in the back of this shithole?” I demand. He looks at me and gives a little bit of a smile. “Come on back old man. I’ll show you what goes on” he says as he motions me to come to the back.
