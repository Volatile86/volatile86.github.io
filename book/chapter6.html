            <p class="text-big">The light was blinding when I reached the entrance. It was like I was dying and being transported to heaven. This looked nothing like it did earlier. The neon signs were lit up dripping light into the rain puddles below. The music was loud now, but it was still shit. I don’t know how people today listen to this garbage. Give me a guitar and a good beat any day. After my eyes refocused after being destroyed by the entrance lights, I was able to see the room. Almost all the booths seem to be filled. Every seat at the bar was also filled. They were taking home a good chunk of change tonight. I quickly noticed the two men that had gotten out of the SUV outside. They were entering a room behind the bar. I walked up closer to the bar. I’m not sure what I was expecting. It’s not like I could hear anything over the excruciating dance beat that was being played. I notice something though. The smell from earlier was gone. They either got the pipe fixed and cleaned up the mess, or the bartender was full of shit and something much worse was going on here. I wait around the bar for a little bit, surveying the clientele. I see one of the bouncers and a younger woman head into the back where I saw the two businessmen go earlier. There's something not right about this whole scene. I've seen enough police procedurals to know that. There is something going on in the back of this piece of shit tavern. There's an evil lurking between its walls. The bartender walks up, and what do you know, it's the same asshole as before. "I thought I told you to get the fuck outta here old man", he says half smiling. He's had a few tonight so far. How else could you explain his jovial attitude? "Honestly, I thought you'd be off work by now. You work full operation hours?" "None of your fucking business buddy. If you're gonna hang out here, you're gonna pay for the privilege. What do you want to drink?", he responded quickly. "Same stuff you gave me earlier. It tasted amazing going down." "Who the fuck are you old man? You think you're funny? That stuff takes like shit. The frat boys love it though. It's cheap as shit too with a high markup. That's why it's always easy to recommend." He laughs. "How about I give you something good?" He turns around behind the bar for a minute and comes back with something foamy and dark. "That's gonna kick you on your ass old man. I can guarantee that ", he said as pushes the beverage toward me. I think about it for a minute, whether I should drink it or not. Fuck it! I'm no coward. I down the son of a bitch. I assume that's how the bartender intended it to be drank since no one could sip on that concoction and take it for long. It tasted like straight up bile, or at least how I imagine bile tastes. He looks at me and smiles."You all right you old fucker. You look a little woozy". I suddenly don't feel so good. My head is spinning. Where am I? How did I get here? Then everything went black.
