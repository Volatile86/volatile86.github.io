"Slow down old man. This the first time you've eaten in a week?" Davidson looks in awe at the speed with which I've devoured my food. Damn. Itâ€™s felt like a week since I've eaten. It feels like I haven't eaten anything good in years now. It's sad when airport terminal food is fine fucking cuisine. I'm in over my head here. I've got a corrupt politician sitting across from me, and he thinks my name is Ronin. "Look Davidson, you caught me following you. What exactly do you want?" "Well, you still haven't told me why you're following me. I have some doubts that you're Ronin. You don't look like the strong silent type. You look like an old fucking kook. That's the only reason I'm sitting down for lunch with you. You need to tell me who told you to follow me, and then you need to go the hell home old man." he says to me in a tone that's just a little too polite. "Look, Mr. Davidson, I assure you I'm Ronin." "OK Ronin, I'll bite. What business are you in?" he asks. Fuck, he's caught me. Well, it was a good run. What business would Ronin be in? I doubt it's drugs. I doubt it's the dog fighting. "Human Trafficking, of course" I say to him confidently.  "You don't know shit old man, you're not Ronin. You're not shit. Tell me why you're following me!" he demands. "I'm in over my head Davidson. I was told to follow you. You've pissed some major players off apparently, and they want you dead. They said they would kill some innocent people I know if I didn't follow you. They were going to have me kill you before you entered the terminal, but you had already gone through security. I don't know what to say. I fucked up somewhere, and here we are." Davidson looked at me for a minute before he spoke. "I know you have no weapon on you. We just got off a plane. You're coming with me for a little bit until I can get this shit figured out." "What if I don't?" I ask. "I've got friends in high places, and you won't survive for long." he replies back. I didn't ask him why his friends in high places didn't just take care of his little problem.
