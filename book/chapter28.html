            <p class="text-big">It's pouring down rain when we reach Chinatown. We headed out the back. Lillian is probably still sitting out in front of my house. I don't see myself coming back alive. This is bad. This fucker means business. He made me drive his car, his gun pointed at me the entire time. We pull up to the apartment building and get out. The neon lights of the storefronts down the street are bright. They make my eyes hurt even this far away. I wipe the rain from my eyes. "What the fuck are you looking at old man. Get the fuck in the building." my guide says to me in a forceful tone. Fuck this guy. He took me at gunpoint from my own home, and I was about to have a nice meal for once. I reluctantly go inside the apartment complex. We walk to the elevator. He is always right behind me. The elevator has a sign on it that says 'Out of Order. Use Stairs'. "Go to the stairs old man" he says to me while pushing his gun to the middle of my back. He pushes harder as we head up the stairs. I'm walking to my own fucking death here. There's no way out for me. There's nothing. Why the fuck didn't I just sit at home eating my noodles and watching the idiot tube. If I had done that, I wouldn't be on my way to greet the reaper. We get to the third floor and arrive in front of the same door I had come to the other day.  The number was still scrawled across the door. The man with the gun still pointed at me beats on the door. "Open up! It’s Che!". The door opens. It's dark as the deepest cave on the darkest moon inside. "Come in, and close that door" I hear a woman say. We both step inside and the person I assume is named Che closes the door. It is pitch fucking black until she turns the light on. There she is. The woman from my dream is sitting in a chair in the corner. She doesn't seem very pleased to see me. "Che, get the hell out of here" she says to the man still pointing his gun at my back. "I don't know if it's wise to leave you alone with this guy. We don't know….". He gets cut off. "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, I SAID" she screams at him. He lowers his gun and walks into the other room. There is blood on the carpet I'm standing on. I can tell it’s pretty fresh. "Now, it seems like we have much to discuss, Ronin" she says as she looks deeply into my eyes.
