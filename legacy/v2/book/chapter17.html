            <p class="text-big">I can feel the sunburn on my left arm as soon as I open my eyes. How long have I been sitting here? It was almost dusk. The patrol car that the officer drove up in is gone. That figures. My luck is total shit. It always has been. This is my last day with Stockwell. I’ve got close to nothing.
I start the engine and start driving home. What the fuck am I going to do? This is it. Is this it? Is this all there is? These are big questions that probably don’t ever deserve any answers. I pass a couple of convenience stores. This town is a dump. I could have been anywhere, but I wasted my life here. I’m driving through the rougher side of town. Hell, I live in the rougher side of town. I notice the neon sign of a tattoo parlor and pull into a parking space. I might as well look into the tattoo angle. I doubt there is any point in it, but this is really one of my last leads. I don’t even know if this is the place where Sara got her tattoo, but I’m out of choices. I walk in the front door. I see a couple of guys doing some work in the back on a couple of pretty rough looking guys. One of them stops, puts down his tattoo gun, and walks up to the front desk. “How you doing, old man. You looking to get some ink? From just a once over, your skin doesn’t look too loose. We should be able to do something with you” he says to me while he sits down in the chair. I stand there for well over a minute just thinking. I’m not even sure how to ask the questions I want to ask. Fuck it! I’ll just come out and say it. I’ve got nothing to lose. “Do you know Lillian Deane?” “Yeah, I know her. Why you ask?” he replies. “May I ask how you know her”. “Yeah, a lot of Pythons come in here for their ink and her brother is one of them. He comes in here every couple of months for a touch up or a new piece.” he explained. I look behind him at the tattoo chairs and the guy still lying on his stomach waiting for the artist to come back. “Thank you. I appreciate your help. You might be seeing me again. I’ll make sure and give you some business next time.” I’m not sure what this new information tells me, if anything. I still feel like I’m flailing. I think this kind of gig might be for the young. I know too much, and nothing surprises me anymore. I leave the tattoo parlor and drive home.
