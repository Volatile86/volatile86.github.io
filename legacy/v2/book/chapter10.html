            <p class="text-big">I hang up the phone quickly. My stomach turns just thinking about it. Robert is either his uncle or his father, but the thing that worries me is that he’s both. This world is fucking sick. It’s a mad world out there. I don’t even understand what’s going on. Everyday, it seems like one more piece of my mind breaks and falls away. I’m probably losing it, but I can’t do anything about that now. I’m too far gone. I gotta figure this mystery out. It might be my last one. I try to move my mind to another place. I think about the cop I saw in the station. Why the hell was he at that biker shithole that night, and who was the businessman he was with? Right now I’ve got more loose ends than I can handle. How does Robert Brown, or Bob, or whatever the hell his name is  fit into all this? I don’t know yet, but I’m sure I’ll find out eventually. Everything in the universe is connected, but some things are more tightly connected than others. I think this net is getting tighter and tighter the more I think about it. I’ve got to get back over to the girl’s mother’s house. I need some more information about who Robert actually is. I’m thinking about what I’m going to ask the woman when the door swings open. It’s fucking Stockwell. What does he want? “Well, what do you got?”, he says demandingly. “Not much at the moment, hoss”. “Well, then what the fuck am I paying you for. You’ve had this case for over a week, and you don’t have anything big? I should have listened to everyone when they told me coming to you was a waste of time and money. Fuck it. You’re off the case. I’ll go elsewhere”, he almost screamed at me. “Now wait there Stockwell. I’ve got some interesting leads, nothing concrete yet, but very interesting. If you go hire another guy right now, he’s gonna have to waste time doing what I’ve already done. Don’t you think it’s best you just stick with the tired old man in front of you?” “Fine, but you got 3 days. I better see something by then. I’ll be expecting a call.”, he says to me right as the phone rings. “Look Stockwell, I gotta take this. Beat it, and I’ll give you a call in a couple days”. Stockwell walks out, and I answer the phone. “Hello”, I speak into the receiver. “Hey, did you just call here and talk to my son?”. It was Sara Deane’s mother. I hang up on her and head for the door.
